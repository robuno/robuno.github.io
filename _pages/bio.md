I am a researcher at [Koç Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Research Group](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr/) and  freelance software developer. I am mostly interested in NLP (language modeling, RAG, fine tuning, etc.) and I follow courses and read in this field. Also, I continue my work in the field of Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) on defending attacks against distributed machine learning algorithms, examining the vulnerabilities of these algorithms and defense methods. Even though I work in the field of privacy & ML, NLP research always seems more interesting to me!

I am also competent to provide and design services on full-stack content management systems, e-mail and payment modules connected to these systems.  

I've been playing guitar for 12 years. I have few covers on YouTube but But these videos are anonymous and I hesitate to post them openly somewhere on my blog. I guess, I listen to rock and classical music the most. Nowadays, I'm trying to learn piano. Handel and Fauré may be my favorite musicians.

I love following and commenting on sports competitions. I have tried many sports since my childhood, from taekwondo to gymnastics and basketball. In 2018, I was among the founders of FK, which produces Turkey's most listened to sports podcasts. During my high school years, some of my articles on football and F1 were published on the most followed sports blogs in Turkey. 

Philosophy might be the field I like to study the most and like to associate with literature. In my first years of university, I used to share blog posts on my previous blog in which I examined the reflection of the works of Sartre, Kieerkegard and a few more philosophers on modern literature.

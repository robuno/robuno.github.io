I just graduated from Department of Computer Engineering, Kadir Has University! I am highly interested in machine learning & deep learning, specifically NLP and Private ML Systems. Currently, I am working as a researcher at [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Research Group](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr/) on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML).

Apart from my work on artificial intelligence, I also develop projects on web technologies. I was intern at [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com/en). You can check my [CV](https://robuno.github.io/files/Resume_Unat_Jan07.pdf) to view more detailed working & research experince. Feel free to contact me via mail or any social media channel! 

:dart: **I'm currently open for new job opportunities!** These days, I'm following [Stanford CS224N course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLryWeHPcBs&list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4) and [CS25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P127jhj-8-Y&list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM), refreshing my basic statistics and ML knowledge with [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) book by K.Murphy. I'm getting ready to gather and share the notes I took while studying NLP, ML, and PPML. I hope you find it on my blog as soon as possible...

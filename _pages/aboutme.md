I just graduated as valedictorian from Department of Computer Engineering, Kadir Has University! I am highly interested in machine learning & DL, specifically NLP and private ML Systems. Previously, I conducted research at [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Research Group](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr/) on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). 

My Research Interests:

- **Privacy and Security in Machine Learning:** Working on adversarial attacks, discovering security threats such as backdoor and,inference attacks, investigation of out-of-distribution data, explainability. <span style="color:darkgray">I have [published paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08618) in this field.</span>
- **Natural Language Processing:** Working on aligning and evaluating LLMs to create trustworthy and safe NLP tools. Besides, investigating explainability and reliability of LMs, training/finetuning of LMs, personalization and development of AI Agents.
- **Intersection and Privacy and LMs:** Focusing on the intersection of privacy and language models (LMs), examining vulnerabilities, adversarial attacks, privacy-preserving techniques, and strategies to mitigate data privacy risks.
- **NLP & ML for Social Good:** Applying ML & NLP tools and methods to address social issues and improve public well-being. Developing models and systems in the intersection of computational social sciences and machine learning.


:dart: **I am currently seeking graduate positions & research assistant roles with scholarship!** These days, I'm trying to complete (I finished most of the parts, including transformers) [Stanford CS224N NLP course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLryWeHPcBs&list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4), and [D. Jurafsky's Speech and Language Processing course](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), refreshing ML knowledge with [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) book by K.Murphy.

Apart from my work on machine learning, I also develop projects on web technologies. I was intern at [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com/en). Currently, I provide full stack web solutions and CMS integration services as a freelance developer. You can check my [CV](https://robuno.github.io/files/Resume_Unat.pdf) to view more detailed working & research experince. Feel free to contact me via mail or any social media channel! 


:heavy_exclamation_mark:_<ins>This blog is still in development and I am trying to add content in my free time. Therefore, you may see some blank/uncompleted pages or content. In any cases, you can contact me via e-mail. More details about me can be found on my social media accounts and [about me](https://robuno.github.io/bio/) page.</ins>_
